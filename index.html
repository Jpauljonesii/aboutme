      <p>
        Hi! My name is Constance Scott. I am orginally from Jackson, TN. I
        graduated from Middle Tennessee State University, also know as MTSU. I
        currently work for a computer company in their finance department as
        Finance Account Manager. I enjoy exercising at the gym and walking
        outside. My favorite color is purple and sometimes light blue. I like
        dogs, my favorite dog is my pitbull Blu, who is 17 years old.
